# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it may not consistently trigger when the user's authentication state changes in the background. This can occur, for instance, due to token refresh or silent sign-in mechanisms.

The `authBug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior. The `authSolution.js` file provides a workaround to address this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project and replace placeholders with your project's config.
4. Run `authBug.js` to see the inconsistent updates. 
5. Run `authSolution.js` to see a possible solution.

## Workaround

The solution involves using a combination of `onAuthStateChanged` with additional checks to detect authentication state changes more reliably.
